# SocialEYE - Social Media Analytics using Deep Neural Networks in Tensorflow 
## Project for Applied AI Class

- Instagram Analytics iPython Notebook - Use's Google Cloud Vision to generate labels/tags for an image. Once multiple images for a user have been tagged using the GC Vision API, we analyze these tags by employing various clustering techniques on word2vec embeddings generated by a pre-trained model. The goal is to gather as much infomration about a user by converting visual content to textual information that can be used in predictive algorithms.

- Twitter Analytics - The purpose is to classify a user's tweets into categories (using a CNN) - in an effort to gauage what the user is most interested in. We then run Stanford NER to see what people, places and organizations a user is most interested in. Please refer to the folder cnn-tf-cahya for more information.
